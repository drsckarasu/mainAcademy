            <td><p>Beijing is an important world capital and global power city, and one of the world's leading centers
                for culture, diplomacy and politics, business and economy, education, language, and science and
                technology. A megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai
                and is the nation's cultural, educational, and political center.[15] It is home to the headquarters of
                most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500
                companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions.[16][17] It is
                also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The
                Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic
                since 2010,[18] and, as of 2016, the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest
                in the world.</p>

            <td><p>Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to
                trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign
                trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were
                subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of
                the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the
                major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949, trade was
                limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined.</p>
