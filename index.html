    <h1>London</h1>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Cheesegrater_and_Gherkin.jpg" width="260" height="300" alt="british_capital">
    <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.
        Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of <b>England</b>, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary
        leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded
        by the Romans. The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2)
        and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.
        <i>The City of Westminster</i> is also an Inner London borough holding city status. Greater London is governed
        by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.</p>
